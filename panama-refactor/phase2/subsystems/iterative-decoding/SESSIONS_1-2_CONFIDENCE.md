# Iterative Decoding: Sessions 1-2

## Session 1: Confidence Scoring (4 hours)

### Objectives
- Implement confidence calculator
- Score all color decisions
- Test confidence accuracy

### Tasks
1. Create confidence_scorer.c
2. Implement compute_confidence() function
3. Track nearest and second-nearest colors
4. Map confidence to 0.0-1.0 scale
5. Unit test with known ambiguous/clear colors
6. Validate confidence correlates with errors

### Deliverables
- Confidence scoring functional
- Unit tests passing
- Confidence metrics documented

## Session 2: Decision Storage (4 hours)

### Objectives
- Store decisions with confidence
- Create decision management API
- Prepare for iterative refinement

### Tasks
1. Define jab_color_decision structure
2. Implement decision array management
3. Create decision query functions
4. Test decision storage and retrieval
5. Document decision lifecycle

### Deliverables
- Decision management complete
- API ready for iterative loop
- Test coverage >90%
