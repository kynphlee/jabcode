# Hybrid Modes: Testing

## Test Scenarios

### Metadata Reliability
- Compare hybrid vs uniform for metadata errors
- Expected: 100% metadata decode (Mode 2)

### Overall Improvement
- Measure hybrid vs uniform pass rates
- Expected: +5-10% improvement

### Compatibility
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Test with standard decoders

## Validation
All modes 3-7 should benefit from hybrid approach.
